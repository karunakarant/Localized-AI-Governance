# Localized AI Governance: State-of-the-Art in Energy Efficiency, Ethical Compliance, and Cultural Adaptation
This paper presents a comprehensive review and empirical evaluation of Localized AI architectures, focusing on their integration with Sociocracy 3.0 (S3) governance for energy-efficient, ethically compliant, and culturally adaptive autonomous systems. Building on the foundational work of Karunakaran & Dhayashankar (2025), we synthesize advances in small language models (SLMs), decentralized governance, and multilingual adaptation. We report a 66% task success rate, 0.77 Consent Compliance Index (CCI), and 0.0793 successes per Joule on edge hardware, validated across 3,271 actions. Our findings, supported by seven recent references, demonstrate that Localized AI is a viable paradigm for sustainable, inclusive, and trustworthy AI deployment.
